# CS255.SystemAnalysis
This is an analysis of a learning management system for DriverPass, an organization whose goal is to better prepare those who are trying to pass the DMV driving test. To better meet the client's needs, I reviewed an interview with DriverPass' owner and his IT officer, where they discussed data, storage, access, security, limitations, and constraints. I was able to meet their needs in a simple, elegant, yet effective way. I was able to effectively use a Gantt chart to schedule the timeline for designing the system. I used UML use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams to effectively represent and communicate the system requirements. I would revise my use case diagram by using more visually appealing paths and data flows. I approach designing software by remaining client-centric. I also remain transparent with the client and my team about our capabilities and areas for opportunity. I make sure everyone is on the same page before and during the design process. I will continue to use UML diagrams, Gantt charts, and documents when designing future systems.
